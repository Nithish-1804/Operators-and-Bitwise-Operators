# Operatoes and Bitwise-Operators

## Operators
Operators in C++ are symbols or special keywords used to perform operations on operands. Operands can be variables, constants, or expressions.

### Uses of Operators
1. **Arithmetic Operators**:Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %) are used for performing basic mathematical calculations.
1. **Assignment Operators**:Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, etc.) are used to assign values to variables.
1. **Comparison Operators**:Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=) are used to compare values and determine relationships between them.
1. **Logical Operators**:Logical operators (&&, ||, !) are used to combine and manipulate Boolean expressions.
1. **Increment and Decrement Operators**:Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators are used to increase or decrease the value of variables.
1. **Conditional (Ternary) Operator**:The conditional operator (?:) is used for simple conditional expressions.

### Advantages of Operators
1. **Efficiency**: Operators provide a concise and efficient way to perform common operations, reducing the need for lengthy and repetitive code.
1. **Readability**: Proper use of operators enhances code readability and simplifies complex operations.
1. **Expressiveness**: Operators allow developers to express operations more naturally, making the code more understandable.

## Bitwise Operators
Bitwise operators in C++ are used to manipulate individual bits of data. They are often used for low-level programming and working with binary data.

### Uses of Bitwise Operators
1. **Bitwise AND (&) and OR (|)**:Used for bitwise AND and OR operations to manipulate individual bits.
1. **Bitwise XOR (^)**:Used for bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operations to toggle specific bits.
1. **Bitwise NOT (~)**:Used to invert or negate all bits.
1. **Bitwise Left Shift (<<) and Right Shift (>>)**:Used to shift bits left or right, effectively multiplying or dividing by powers of 2.

### Advantages of Bitwise Operators
1. **Efficient Bit Manipulation**: Bitwise operators provide an efficient means to manipulate individual bits or groups of bits, often used in embedded systems, graphics programming, and cryptography.
1. **Memory Management**: They are crucial for tasks that involve memory management, such as setting and clearing flags in hardware registers.
1. **Optimization**: In certain cases, bitwise operators can be used for optimization, as they provide low-level control over data representation and manipulation.
